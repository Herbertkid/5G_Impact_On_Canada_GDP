# 5G_Impact_On_Canada_GDP

In this project, we predict the 5G impacts on GDP of Canada and other three areas, including Ontario, Albert and Quebec. 
We study on the formula indicates the relationship of 5G deployment cost and GDP increment. The GDP multipliers that can be used to convert investment in the 5G ecosystem into economic outcomes which is the GDP increment. Besides, the population density, land area and 5G deployment cost on IoT will influence the total deployment cost. In the paper, we give the detailed discussion. 

According to these equations, the prediction processes is given below. The data in the blue box can be found online and the data in yellow box needs to be calculated and predicted.

We provide the overall trend of GDP from 2010 to 2030 based on the previous data and the predicted value, which is shwon below.
